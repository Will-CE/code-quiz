This assignment submission is my attempt at accomplishing the code quiz assignment.
In my script.js file I have created variables and an array of 5 objects that displays 3 key-value pairs each. One a question, another with a list of 4 options to asnwer the question, and one correct answer.

I have also created a count down timer set to countdown, i--, at 45seconds.
